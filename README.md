# GitUser - Mobile Test

First of all, there is things to complete and improve.
My first excuse is... There was no much time, since I already had plans between Thusday and Friday. 
The lack of knowledge with Kotlin is huge... Or should I say, was? Well, I've never programed with Kotlin (Only Java) so that's another reason why everything isn't finished and polished.

But no more escuses, let's see what's done.

Search
---
Done:
* Alert when there is nothing inserted
* Alert when there is multiple users (The ideia here was to make a recyclerview inside a alertdialog. That way the user could pick the right one)
* Opens Details Activity if one user is found

Not done:
* Layout is not prepared for landscape mode (Neither Details Activity, but it looks just fine)

Details
---

Done:
* Name, Email, and Avatar
* User can return to Search Activity

Not done:
* List with followers (Could have done if I had a little more time)
* Avatar might not appear (Simply because after found the user, it jumps to Details Activity before it has the time to download the Avatar)

Apologies
-

I must apologize for some things...

1.  If the code is a mess, that's probably because of the lack of knowledge in Kotlin.
2.  I had to authenticate if I wanted to get the emails. I used basic authentication and the credentials are explicit in the code.
3.  Since I was running low on time commits were affected.
4.  Sorry for pushing all project files :|
